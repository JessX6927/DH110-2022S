## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation

Zhengbai Xia | DH110 | Spring 2022

### Project Description

Picking up a new habit or learning a new hobby during one's mid-age can be challenging; therefore, in the contemporary digital world, constructing accessible websites for learning purposes plays a critical role in helping individuals better navigate the world of their interests. Specifically, a website or application with a user-friendly and human-orientated perspective will facilitate the learning progress as well as delight the studying environment. Hence, for this project, I aim to examine the useability and accessibility of music websites from the position of the mid-aged men; additionally, I want to provide practical suggestions and comments with the intention of creating and establishing an interactive space and a human-centered design for the targeting demographic. 

### Jakob Nielson's [10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) Listed with Explanations 

| # | Heuristics | Explanations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Visibility of System Status | Users should be aware of the environment and the navigation system and given responses and proper interactions within an ideal time frame |
| 2 | Match Between System and the Real World | Selecting, adapting, and using user-friendly concepts and logical ways of saying |
| 3 | User Control and Freedom | Creating a direct and identifiable undo or redo button which allows the users to exit the unwanted space |
| 4 | Consistency and Standards | Keeping internal and external consistency (a sense of uniformity) of terminologies and actions that coincide with the belonging sphere |
| 5 | Error Prevention | Establishing a condition or warning that helps to prevent errors due to unconsciousness |
| 6 | Recognition Rather Than Recall | Constructing interfaces that are easy for users to recognize and connect with the other sections |
| 7 | Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | Providing quicker access for more experienced users and giving personalized functions and options for each individual |
| 8 | Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | Drawing the viewers' attention to the essential contents, avoiding unnecessary and misleading designs |
| 9 | Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors | Displaying error messages and suggested solutions in the most apparent and legible way |
| 10 | Help and Documentation | Ensuring that there are additional assistance and guidelines in documentation stated for the users who need further help|

### [Severity Ratings](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/) for Usability Problems by Nielsen Norman Group

On a scale of 1 to 3:

1 = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project  
2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority  
3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority

#### Numbers presented in parentheses (bold) following each usability Heuristic evaluation reflect the corresponding rating.
