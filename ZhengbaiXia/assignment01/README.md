# Music Learning for Mid-aged Men

## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation

Zhengbai Xia | DH110 | Spring 2022

### Project Description

Picking up a new habit or learning a new hobby during one's mid-age can be challenging; therefore, in the contemporary digital world, constructing accessible websites for learning purposes plays a critical role in helping individuals better navigate the world of their interests. Specifically, a website or application with a user-friendly and human-orientated perspective will facilitate the learning progress as well as delight the studying environment. Hence, for this project, I aim to examine the useability and accessibility of music websites from the position of the mid-aged men; additionally, I want to provide practical suggestions and comments with the intention of creating and establishing an interactive space and a human-centered design for the targeting demographic.

### [Severity Ratings](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/) for Usability Problems by Nielsen Norman Group

On a scale of 1 to 3:

1 = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project  
2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority  
3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority

#### Numbers presented in parentheses (bold) following each usability Heuristic evaluation reflect the corresponding rating.


## Website 1: [teoría](https://www.teoria.com/index.php)

### Brief Intro & Overall Evaluation
[teoría](https://www.teoria.com/index.php) is an interactive website developed by José Rodríguez Alvira; it displays four major sections including Tutorials, Exercises, Reference, and Articles to help the learners to develop a comprehesive knowledge about music theories and practices. Each section divides into several sub-categories that further elaborate on specific terminologies, concepts, and activities. Users are able to click on a variety videos, sound tracks, and quizzes to practice and examine their learning progress and skills. In addition, the website also provides many scholarly resources to support and supplement their definitions and materials. 

From the first glance, I do not feel like this website is very beginner friendly since it presents a lot of professional terminologies from the get-go. The navigation of the website is a little bit confusing due to the lack of direct connections among the four sections as well as the repetition of some articles and materials. I think the userers will find it hard to learn without an instructor's guidance. I will evaluate this website in details while explicitly applying and identifying the Ten Usability Heuristics from the perspective of the mid-aged men.

## Heuristic Evaluation

#### 1. Visibility of System Status
* Based on the presentation of the homepage, the titles of the four major sections of this website are not identical between the headings and the main page's catergories. This might cause confusion to the users because they will not associate the connection among all the different titles from the first glance. 
 **(2)** 
 
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92048501/161963283-069eae7e-8b6a-4533-9faa-aa817e8a1eb9.png)
 
 > *Recommendation: Keeping the titles as the same as the headings in the main page, and it is preferable to add more detailed information below the big title or just elaborate on the topic once the user clicks on the section.* 

* The four images which are corresponding to the four independent sections are not ideally representative of the materials introduced within each category. Futhermore, the chosen images required a certain amount of music knowledge. Such relatively professional presentation might scared some of the potential users off, especially when the considering the case of the mid-aged men. 
 **(3)** 
 
> *Recommendation: Selecting or designing more direct and learner-friendly images or even simplified signs/symbols might be easier for attracting and guiding the viewers.*   

#### 2. Match Between System and the Real World
* Within the Tutorials section, the website provide a decent amout of information in explaining how to read music. However, for a beginner, this section still involves a lot of academic, internal, and professional words and phrases. Even though it is not possible to avoid using these terminologies, it will be better if the concepts are explained and demonstrated with more real-life conneciton or instances. Such basic knowledge is essential and especially crucial for the people who just started to learn music theory; therefore, it will be more accessible for them if more real-world conventions are adoppted in the descriptions.

 > *Recommendation: Imdeding videos that invited lecturers to introduce and explain the concepts will be much easiler for the users since it will be more direct and comprehensible for the first-time learners. In addition, the terminologies can be associated with real-life examples or connected with ideas from other fields. If some of the music concepts can be in dialogue with the man's current profession, it will be much convenient for him to grasp the knowledge and the essence.* 

* The entire Reference section requires a high-level of musical skill; it is quite confusing and difficult to understand for the first-time users with the amout of professional terminologies. 
 **(3)**

> *Recommendation: Including more video clips, sound tracks, or interactive activities will be helpful for the beginners to fully comprehend the concepts and eventually be familiar with them.* 

#### 3. User Control and Freedom
* In the Exercises section, learners can practice and test their listening and identifying ability. However, all of the exercises, for instance, within the case of interval ear training, if the individual accidentally clicks the wrong answer, then he cannot go back and redo the sound. The only option is to exit the exercise and retstart the test again if the user wants the most accurate result/reflection of their ability.

> *Recommendation: Although people can always go back and redo the entire test again, it will be more convenient and efficient if there a button of repeating the last sound or just simply providing a "return" or "go back" choice.* 

#### 4. Consistency and Standards
* From the Articles section, there are many identical essays that appear more than one time across different sub-categories. As in the example that I provided below, there are three overlapping articles between "instruments" and "history." For the purpose of maintaining consistency but also cohesion, such repetition of the same documentation should be avovided. Redundance does not mean consistency. Besides, the visual presentation as well as the materials of the Articles section are relatively separated from the rest of the sections which will give the users a sense of lose in connection.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92048501/161979672-746a4f85-7347-4516-a6a0-b1eab95bbae4.png)

> *Recommendation: It is better to arrange the articles in alphabetical order and tag each of their distinctive characterisitcs/sub-categories. In this way, this section will have more consistency on its own. Also, the articles could refer back to some of the terminologies that are introduced in other sections (maybe a link back to the concepts), so that the entire website will have more consistency throughout.*

#### 5. Error Prevention
* When users are practicing their learning ability and gained skills in the Exercises section, if they made slips, unfortunately there is no way for them to go back and change their selections. The only thing they can do is just restart the entire test again which puts a higher cost on the users' time. In addition, there are no boundaries amomng different answers; thus, it will be even more likely for the learners to unconsciously click on the wrong choice.

> *Recommendation: Users should be warned and reconfirmed before they select the answer, on extra step of confirmation will save the learners from a lot of potential mistakes. Also, adding a outline around each answer of giving it a selecting effect when a person chooses the symbol will help in reduing unwanted and inattentive errors.*

#### 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
* The Tutorials section maintains a good recognition within each subcategories as the terminologies are appearing repeatedly corresponding to the learning objectives. However, when looking at acrossing the sub-categories, there are barely connections or repetitions in concepts among different ones. Thus, at the end of the learning period of music theory, people might forget some of the ideas present at the very beginning. 
 **(2)** 
 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92048501/161986420-8c18e9ff-2ec7-441d-a4b5-dcc640cd7042.png)

> *Recommendation: It will be easier for the learners if there are more associations constructed among the sub-categories. In addition, whenever there's a past term mentioned, there can be a inserted link of that term to where it is explained in the first place. In this way, it will be more helpful for the userers to recognize the learned ideas.*

#### 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
* Although the Tutorials and Exercises sections are highly conncected and associated, there are not shortcuts or references between two sections. After the users took the test, if they discover that there are something that they need to review, they isn't a direct link for them to refer back to the concept in the Tutorials. If they want to practice and apply the skills they justed learned, there also isn't an efficient shortcut for them to go straightly to the Exercises.
 **(2)** 
 
> *Recommendation: It will be better if the developers could establish a connection between the Tutorials and Exercises sections. As such, the users will consolidate their learned skills more efficiently, and there will be more flexibility for the userers as they could be more easiler to pick which specific concept they want to navigate or practice more times.*

#### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
* The section that presents the articles especially does not demonstrate the minimalist design. Besides the repetition for the previous sub-categories, there are also two additional search options of "By Composer" and "By Author." Once again, many of the individuals are repeated for more than one time. Also, the choice of list the people next to the concepts is confusing and repetitive as well as the articles displayed are entirely the same.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92048501/161993057-99deed34-a461-4759-b359-ae56738edd1f.png)

> *Recommendation: It will be more aesthetic of the developer listed all the scholarly individuals alphabetically as a bar/column on the left. And once the user clicks on it, it will show the associated scholars with their title and preferably with the tags of the sub-categories for each article.*

#### 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors
* Within the Exercises section, for explame as in the practice of "Chord, Scales, and Modes" in Jazz, when users did not select the right one, the phrase "wrong answer" is not in red or even a larger size. In addition, the correct answer is not in green and the reasons behind selecting the one are not displayed as well.
 **(2)** 
 
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92048501/161996206-ed5a1a40-941a-4a01-9246-f337cfcaa33e.png)

 > *Recommendation: The website will presents a more direct visual effect of the phrase of "wrong answer" is in red and "correct answer" is in green. Also, it will be much more convenient for the users if there are embeded videos to explain the reasons behind the selecting process. This design will faciliate the learning process of the individuals.*

#### 10. Help and Documentation
* The Help section is well-designed in this website. One thing I discovered is that the additional guidance for the Exercises section is missing one of the sub-categories.

 > *Recommendation: Adding a the missing category of Ear Training and Sight Singing Practice in the Help Section.*

* Also, the Help section includes a lot of supplementing materials for Tutorials and Reference Sections, yet are not indicated to the users that there are detailed study guides prepared for them.

 > *Recommendation: Explicitly states that they are study guidelines in the Help Section at the Tutorials and Reference space or even moving some of the materials from "Help" to the major four sections.*
